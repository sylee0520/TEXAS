This is the repository of '<b>TEXAS</b>: <b>TEX</b>tbook summarization <b>A</b>nd question generation for <b>S</b>tudent' for AIKU team Project! TEXAS is the framework that summarizes your own textbook data and generates the question & answer set based summarized text. When you study for your major, it is the most effective to summarize what you've learned and solve the related problems. However, in most textbooks, information is spread widely and there are not many problems provided and in addition, not all existing problems have answers. It often makes study hard. So we released the TEXAS for relieving this problems. We also provide data summarizing open-source computer science textbooks as TEXAS and a set of questions and answers created using them. Use TEXAS to get an A+ this semester!
